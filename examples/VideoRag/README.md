# VideoRag: a video reader for Microsoft.Extensions.DataIngestion

A sample, not a package (issue #635; the scoping note is docs/ideas/dataingestion-video-reader.md). It turns a video
into searchable chunks with [Microsoft.Extensions.DataIngestion](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/conceptual/data-ingestion)
(MEDI) and answers a question with the shot it found and that shot's times.

```
video ──VideoDocumentReader──► one section per shot ──ImageAlternativeTextEnricher──► captioned stills
      ──SectionChunker──► a chunk per shot, its "## start – end" header as context ──VectorStoreWriter──► in-memory store
```

- **`VideoDocumentReader`** (an `IngestionDocumentReader`) detects the shots with `ShotDetection.DetectAsync` and makes
  one `IngestionDocumentSection` per shot: a header `## 00:00:02.000 – 00:00:04.000`, a paragraph naming the shot, and,
  when FFmpeg 8's shared libraries load, the shot's middle frame as a JPEG (FrameReader's `ImageEncoder`, at most
  640 px wide) with no alternative text yet. Each element's metadata has the shot's number and its start and end in
  seconds. A `Stream` that isn't a file's is copied to a temporary file first, since the stills seek.
- **Why the header**: MEDI's chunkers don't carry element metadata into the chunks, but `SectionChunker` makes a
  section's first header the context of every chunk in it, and `VectorStoreWriter` stores that context. So each stored
  record says where in the video it is, with no custom chunker.
- **`ImageAlternativeTextEnricher`** (MEDI's own) captions every still with a vision model; the chunker then embeds the
  caption. That's the visual search. Transcripts are a later slice.
- **`VideoIndex`** puts the pipeline together on Semantic Kernel's in-memory vector store and searches it.

## Run it

```
dotnet run --project examples/VideoRag -- --ffmpeg-libs <dir> --ask "where are the colour bars?" video.mp4
```

Without `--ask` it asks for questions on the console. Each answer lists the nearest chunks with their score, the shot's
times and its text.

- **FFmpeg**: `--ffmpeg-libs` (or `SHOTDETECTOR_FFMPEG_LIBS`) names a folder with FFmpeg 8's shared libraries: an
  FFmpeg 8 "shared" build, or the ones in the [FrameReader.Native](../../src/FrameReader.Native/README.md) packages
  (LGPL-2.1-or-later; the sample doesn't reference them). Without them the shots still become sections, with no stills,
  and detection runs through the `ffmpeg` executable on PATH.
- **Models**: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, through Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI.

  | Variable | Default | |
  |---|---|---|
  | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (needed for OpenAI) | Any value for a local server. |
  | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenAI | e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama. |
  | `VIDEORAG_CHAT_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | A vision model: it captions the stills. |
  | `VIDEORAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | |
  | `VIDEORAG_DIMENSIONS` | `1536` | The embedding model's vector size. |

## Caveats

- MEDI is preview; the sample pins `10.11.0-preview.1.26513.7` (Directory.Packages.props) and may need changes on the
  next one.
- A shot is the unit: a long shot is one chunk (the chunker splits it only past its token limit). Grouping shots into
  scenes, and transcripts from the soundtrack, are the next slices (the scoping note, section 3).
- AOT and trimming are untested here.

The test, tests/VideoRag.Tests, runs the reader and the whole pipeline offline on a 3-shot clip, with a stub chat
client and a bag-of-words embedding generator.
